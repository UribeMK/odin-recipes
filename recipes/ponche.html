    </li>
    <li>Stir to make sure the tea and fruit mix well.</li>
    <li>Add the dried hibiscus flowers. Remove once the ponche has achieved a nice red tint. Do not leave the flowers for a long time or your ponche may become bitter </li>
    <li>Disolve the piloncillo in a separate cup using the ponche you mixed so that is dissolves well and add into the mix. Taste and adjust to your liking of sweetness.</li>
    <li>Serve in a cup and add some of the cooked fruit into the cup for visual appeal. If adding liquor, best to use a clear spirit that won't change the taste so much, vodka or whiskey is recommended.</li>
